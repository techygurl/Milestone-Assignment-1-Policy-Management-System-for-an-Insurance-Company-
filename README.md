## 📁 Project Structure


---


This project is a simple object-oriented insurance management system built with Python. It simulates a basic workflow for managing insurance **products**, **policyholders**, and **payments**.

---

## 🧩 What the Code Does

- Product Management: Allows creation, update, and suspension of insurance products.
- Policyholder Management: Lets users register for products, suspend/reactivate their accounts, and track their policies.
- Payment Processing: Accepts payments, sends reminders, and can apply penalties.

The system demonstrates how two sample policyholders (**Peace** and **Joyce**) interact with the system by registering for products and making payments.
